# Project 2: Design Journey

**For each milestone, complete only the sections that are labeled with that milestone.** Refine all sections before the final submission. If you later need to update your plan, **do not delete the original plan, leave it place and append your new plan below the original.** Explain why you are changing your plan. Remember you are graded on your design process. Updating the plan documents your process!

**Replace ALL _TODOs_ with your work.** (There should be no TODOs in the final submission.)

Be clear and concise in your writing. Bullets points are encouraged.

**Everything, including images, must be visible in Markdown Preview.** If it's not visible in Markdown Preview, then we won't grade it. We won't give you partial credit either. **Your design journey should be easy to read for the grader; in Markdown Preview the question _and_ answer should have a blank line between them.**


## Design / Plan (Milestone 1)

**Make the case for your decisions using concepts from class, as well as other design principles, theories, examples, and cases from outside of class (includes the design prerequisite for this course).**

You can use bullet points and lists, or full paragraphs, or a combo, whichever is appropriate. The writing should be solid draft quality.

### Audiences (Milestone 1)

> Who are your site's audiences?
> Briefly explain who the intended audiences are for your project website.
> **DO NOT INVENT RANDOM AUDIENCES HERE!** Use the audiences from the requirements.

_Consumer_: Parents with developing children who want to provide high-quality, nature-rich places on a smaller scale around thier homes and communities by picking plants that will provide year-round interest and help engage children in plant play.

_Site Administrator_: Members of the Playful Plants Project from Cornell University that wish to develop a searchable database of playful plants and a web resource for sharing ideas and information with thier consumers (parents, community, educational organizations).


### _Consumer_ Audience Goals (Milestone 1)

> Document your audience's goals.
> List each goal below. There is no specific number of goals required for this, but you need enough to do the job.
> **DO NOT INVENT RANDOM GOALS HERE OR STEREOTYPE HERE!** Your goals are things that your users want accomplish when using the site (e.g. print a list of plants). These are informed by the Playful Plants objectives. Review the assignment's requirements for details.

_Consumer_ Goal 1: Find the plants that fit the requirements they are looking for. (E.g. find a plant that can grow in their weather and supports certain types of play for thier child.)

- **Design Ideas and Choices** _How will you meet those goals in your design?_
  - I will use a media catalog that provides large images that make it easier for the consumer to browse through the database visually. I will have section to let the consumer filter and sort what types of plants are being displayed.
- **Rationale & Additional Notes** _Justify your decisions; additional notes._
  - Images are easier to scan over and will provide the consumer with information about the appearance of the plant since this is an important aspect in their decision of whether they want to plant it or let thier children play with it.

_Consumer_ Goal 2: Gain all the information necessary to know how to take care of a plant.

- **Design Ideas and Choices** _How will you meet those goals in your design?_
  - I will make sure that the details page provides information for basic plant care for all plants.
- **Rationale & Additional Notes** _Justify your decisions; additional notes._
  - The consumer cares about creating nature-rich spaces and likely will want to garden using this data, so to meet this goal I need to provide them with this data. Since there is a lot of data, I will make this information available when the consumer clicks on the plant for more details.

_Consumer_ Goal 3: Print a specific plant's care information

- **Design Ideas and Choices** _How will you meet those goals in your design?_
  - I will make the page for individual plants printer-friendly (smaller image, fit to one standard page).
- **Rationale & Additional Notes** _Justify your decisions; additional notes._
  - The consumer wants to know how to care for the plants that they choose to plant. By providing a way to print the page with care information, they can have this information physically without having to come to the website and search for this plant every time they need to use this information.



### _Consumer_ Persona (Milestone 1)

> Use the goals you identified above to develop a persona of your site's audience.
> Create your persona using GenderMag's customizable personas.
> Take a screenshot and include it here. Persona must be visible in Markdown Preview; do not use PDF format!

![Consumer Persona Ali](/design-plan/persona_consumer1.jpg)


### _Administrator_ Audience Goals (Milestone 1)

> Document your audience's goals.
> List each goal below. There is no specific number of goals required for this, but you need enough to do the job.
> **DO NOT INVENT RANDOM GOALS HERE OR STEREOTYPE HERE!** Your goals are things that your users want accomplish when using the site (e.g. print a list of plants). These are informed by the Playful Plants objectives. Review the assignment's requirements for details.

_Administrator_ Goal 1: Add, Edit, and Delete information from the Playful Plants Database

- **Design Ideas and Choices** _How will you meet those goals in your design?_
  - I will have a link within each plant entry that allows the administrator to edit its information. They will also be able to delete entries in this way. I will have an Add Plant form that allows the user to add information (text, image, etc.) to the database.
- **Rationale & Additional Notes** _Justify your decisions; additional notes._
  - Members of the Playful Plants Project have an objective to develop a database that their consumers can use to find all of the available plants and their traits.

_Administrator_ Goal 2: Filter and Sort the Database

- **Design Ideas and Choices** _How will you meet those goals in your design?_
  - I will have a sidebar that allows them to sort by important information categories such as play type and other tags.
- **Rationale & Additional Notes** _Justify your decisions; additional notes._
  - Members of the Playful Plants Project will want to be able to see what is currently in the database and how many of each plant they may have for each tag. This way they will know what is in the database and can make informed decisions about what needs to be added.

### _Administrator_ Persona (Milestone 1)

> Use the goals you identified above to develop a persona of your site's audience.
> Create your persona using GenderMag's customizable personas.
> Take a screenshot and include it here. Persona must be visible in Markdown Preview; do not use PDF format!

### Site Design (Milestone 1)

> Document your _entire_ design process. **We want to see iteration!**
> **Show us the evolution of your design from your first idea (sketch) to the final design you plan to implement (sketch).**
> **Show us how you decided what data to display to each audience.**
> **Plan your URLs for the site.**
> **Provide a brief explanation _underneath_ each design artifact (2-3 sentences).** Explain what the artifact is, how it meets the goals of your personas (**refer to your personas by name**).
>
> **Important!** Plan _all_ site requirements. Don't forget login and logout.

_Initial Designs / Design Iterations:_

![Consumer View Sketch 1](/design-plan/consumersketch1.jpeg)

I sketched two designs (seperated by pink line). Since this is a mobile site, Abi would prefer the right sketch with the Sort as a dropdown and Filter as a hamburger menu. This is because it makes the site more usable and follows common design patterns so she is less likely to give-up on using this technology. Additionally, the hamburger menu appears when tapping the "Filter By" button and will include instructions on how to use the filtering system. The small tiles rather than an aside column is better fit for smaller screens, which Abi will be using to view this site. Additionally, being able to view the plants visually first is more helpful and usable than including all plant details on the screen at once, which is likely to confuse and overwhelm her.

![Admin View Sketch 1](/design-plan/adminsketch1.jpeg)

My first itteration of the administrator view of the website was to have a sidebar similar to Project 2 and have long tiles in the main body of the website. There is a seperate page for the login page and there are buttons (once logged in) to edit or delete plants.

![Admin View Sketch 2](/design-plan/adminsketch2.jpeg)

I itterated the administrator view to instead have square tiles with information under them like the consumer view. This gives Tim a better idea of how the information will be displayed on the consumer view version of the website without logging out. The first box is a button to add a new plant, which is a form on a seperate page. This follows common design patterns I have seen before on gallery websites and applications, which Tim is likely familiar with.

![Admin View Sketch 2 Edit and Confirmation Pages](/design-plan/adminsketch2_editandconfirmation.jpeg)

After clicking on the Edit button on a plant's tile, the link opens that plant's details page as a form with its existing data values in the form values. After a plant is added, there is a confirmation page that allows Tim to either add another plant or navigate back to the catalog page.

![Admin View Sketch 2 Edit page Itteration 2](/design-plan/adminsketch2_edit2.jpeg)

An alternative design for the edit page is to have each field have an "edit" button next to it that must be clicked to display the text field or dropdown form. This may avoid logistic difficulties because it can prevent Tim from accidentally changing information he didn't mean to change, but also may be difficult to code and allow for multiple fields to be changed at once, so I am not sure if this is the design I want to go with.

_Final Design:_

![Consumer View Sketch 2](/design-plan/consumersketch2.jpeg)

I itterated my first sketch to include more instructions and clarification for features on the website to aid Abi and her cognitive styles. This information will not only make her feel more comfortable clicking on certain buttons/links and feel informed, but also supports her comprehensive information proccessing style.

![Admin View Sketch 2](/design-plan/adminsketch2.jpeg)

I will use my second sketch for the admin view that uses square tiles. For now, I also plan on using the above edit page, which when logged in as admin, displays all values of the details page within a form and allows for multiple edits at once, with a "save changes" button at the bottom.

![Login Page](/design-plan/loginsketch.jpg)

The login page will be a seperate page with only the login form. It will only be accessible when the user isn't logged in.


### Design Pattern Explanation/Reflection (Milestone 1)

> Write a one paragraph (6-8 sentences) reflection explaining how you used design patterns for media catalogs in your site's final design.

My design reflects common media catalog design patterns by implementing image tiles with short captions that expand into more detailed pages. I based this off of the small-screen version of the seedsavers.org website. This website similarly as a seperate login page, as do most websites that implmenet catalogs such as online shopping sites or Instagram. When given the ability to edit a post on Instagram or a blog, it presents the user with a form that has existing data within the form fields already, which is why the Edit page for Tim will has a similar pattern. I decided to have the Add Plant "button" be an empty tile following the design patterns I see on other gallery editing websites, such as on Notion, but instead put this button at the top because the Playful Plants Project will have too many entries to put this "add plant" tile at the bottom of the page.


### Cognitive Styles Explanation/Reflection (Milestone 1)

> Write a one paragraph (6-8 sentences) reflection explaining how your final design supports the cognitive styles of each persona.

_Consumer Cognitive Styles Reflection:_

Abi feels comfortable with technologies she has used before, so I am implementing similar design patterns to other websites to make it less likely she gives up on using the website due to confusion. Additionally, a lot of information is included on the page to give instructions to what the "Sort By" and "Filter By" Buttons do so that although she is risk averse, she feels comfortable and understands what will happen when she uses these features. Instructions will be provided to explain to Abi that detailed information on the plant's care can be found by clicking on the plant's image/name. By providing these instructions and information, not only does it aid her in regards to her risk averse, low computer self-efficacy, and learning by process cognitive styles, but it also synergizes with her comprehensive information processing style since this important information will all be at the top of the page and easy to read over before proceeding down the page. This will give her information about how to accomplish her tasks/goals with technology in a straightforward way that prevents her from wasting time.


_Site Administrator Cognitive Styles Reflection:_

Tim enjoys tinkering and has a selective learning style. My design uses headers and properly labeled buttons that follow common design patterns to give Tim promising leads. Although Tim does have tasks and goals to accomplish as a member of the Playful Plants Project, he enjoys exploring new technologies and finding shortcuts, so by using valid HTML formatting he has the opportunity and use the features of his web browser to better tinker with the features of the website.


## Implementation Plan (Milestone 1, Milestone 2, Milestone 3, Final Submission)

### Database Schema (Milestone 1)

> Describe the structure of your database. You may use words or a picture. A bulleted list is probably the simplest way to do this. Make sure you include constraints for each field.
> **Hint: You probably need a table for "entries", `tags`, `"entry"_tags`** (stores relationship between entries and tags), and a `users` tables.
> **Hint: For foreign keys, use the singular name of the table + _id.** For example: `image_id` and `tag_id` for the `image_tags` (tags for each image) table.

//these field names are long, but in my code I will have to shorten the HTTP parameter versions of them for URL purposes

Table: plants

- id: INTEGER {PK, U, NN, AI},
- name: TEXT {NN},
- sci_name: TEXT {U, NN},
- pp_id: TEXT {U, NN}, //playful plants ID
- exploratory_constructive: INTEGER {NN}
- exploratory_sensory: INTEGER {NN}
- physical: INTEGER {NN}
- imaginative: INTEGER {NN}
- restorative: INTEGER {NN}
- expressive: INTEGER {NN}
- play_with_rules: INTEGER {NN}
- bio: INTEGER {NN}

// tags for sorting for consumers, such as classification and growing needs

Table: tags

- id: INTEGER {PK, U, NN, AI},
- tag_name: TEXT {U, NN}

Table: entry_tags

- id: INTEGER {PK, U, NN, AI},
- plant_id: INTEGER {}
- tag_id: INTEGER {}

Table: users

- id: INTEGER {PK, U, NN, AI},
- username: TEXT {U, NN},
- password: TEXT {NN}


### Database Query Plan (Milestone 1, Milestone 2, Milestone 3, Final Submission)

> Plan _all_ of your database queries. You may use natural language, pseudocode, or SQL.

```
Getting all plants data (consumer and administrator):

SELECT * FROM plants;
```

```
Ordering displayed plants (consumer and administrator):

SELECT * FROM plants ORDER BY $orderfield_and_direction;
  e.g. SELECT * FROM plants ORDER BY name ASC;
```

```
Ordering and Filtering plants (consumer):

SELECT * FROM plants JOIN entry_tags ON plants.id=entry_tags.plant_id ORDER BY $orderfield_and_direction WHERE $filter_conditions;
  e.g. SELECT * FROM plants JOIN entry_tags ON plants.id=entry_tags.plant_id ORDER BY name ASC WHERE tag_id=1;
  (Not too sure about how joins work yet.)
```

```
Ordering and Filtering plants (admin):

SELECT * FROM plants ORDER BY $orderfield_and_direction WHERE $filter_conditions;
  e.g. SELECT * FROM plants ORDER BY name ASC WHERE ex_c=1 OR ex_s=1;
```





### Code Planning (Milestone 1, Milestone 2, Milestone 3, Final Submission)
